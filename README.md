# Untitled PT Credits Project
A little project I made in GMS2 (or just Gamemaker), which mimics Pizza Tower's Credits Sequence, but you can modify the text and anything else about it!
# Installation
Download the project files and put them in your Gamemaker Projects Directory (usually in your Documents folder on Windows) and putting them in there.
