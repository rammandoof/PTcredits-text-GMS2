# Untitled PT Credits Project
A little project I made in GMS2 (or just Gamemaker), which mimics Pizza Tower's Credits Sequence, but you can modify the text and anything else about it!

# Installation
Install Gamemaker Studio 2 (or just Gamemaker). I used Runtime v2024.2.0.163 with an IDE of v2024.2.0.132 Steam, although you can probably also use newer or even older versions of Gamemaker, just try it out :) .

Download the .zip file and put them in your Gamemaker Projects Directory (usually in your Documents folder on Windows), extracting them and putting them in there.

Picture of the usual Directory:

After all of this, start Gamemaker (if you haven't) and goto File > Open Project > Project Directory* > Untitled PT Credits Project.

(Ignore the highlighted New Project, just a bug with snipping tools...)

You can delete both of the README.md and .gitattributes files, but I highly discourage deleting any of the other files!

*The Project Directory is the Directory where your Project is stored (look at the Image above).

# Modyfing
You can modify anything about this project, but there is a small guide in the Project itself if you only need the change the text!

A: No.


Q: Can I use this with monetary gain?
